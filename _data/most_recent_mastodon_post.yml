description: <p>One of the few nice things about working at a certain summer tech
  camp (which I hate with a burning passion) is that I was able to get the <a href="https://fosstodon.org/tags/3dprinting"
  class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>3dprinting</span></a> class to print me
  a pen holder for some of my <a href="https://fosstodon.org/tags/fountainpens" class="mention
  hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>fountainpens</span></a>! They made some other prints but
  the holes were too small for a <a href="https://fosstodon.org/tags/fountainpen"
  class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>fountainpen</span></a>. One of those failed
  holders was a 3D version of the <a href="https://fosstodon.org/tags/Poland" class="mention
  hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Poland</span></a> flag which still looks cool on my desk.</p>

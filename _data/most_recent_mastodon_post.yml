description: <p>Just bought a Fujifilm Instax Mini 12, my first instant film camera.
  As a complete camera noob I’d say the pictures it takes aren’t bad, but I am slightly
  disappointed by the lack of detail. It’s also interesting dealing with the bright
  California sky…</p><p>That said, I mail my girlfriend a letter every week (at least
  I try to). Slipping in photos from this camera should be something to make her experience
  of opening them even better!</p><p><a href="https://fosstodon.org/tags/instantphotography"

description: <p>Recently I finished up a summer job and gifted my two bosses a letter
  each where I thanked them for being so great to work and learn under.</p><p>It’s
  one thing to tell them this in person, or even over an email, but taking the extra
  time to write out on paper my thoughts and then seal them (I hope) really shows
  how genuine/important the words I wrote were.</p><p>Besides, this was a great way
  to use some pens/inks I’ve been neglecting until now!</p><p><a href="https://fosstodon.org/tags/stationery"

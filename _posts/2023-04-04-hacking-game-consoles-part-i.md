## Introduction

As weird as it sounds to say this, if you have a video game console you should try hacking it!
And I'm not suggesting you do this to pirate games.
But before I get into that let me give you a bit of a personal backstory.

As a pre-teen, I grew up with my favorite gadget in the world, my aqua-blue Nintendo 3DS.
I got it in 2011 right before the first price drop, which meant that I got to be a part of something called the ambassador program which let me download several Gameboy Advance games for free.

It was great, and I literally took it with me everywhere I went.
However, in 2013 I lost it while meeting up with a friend of mine at Central Park in New York City.

Years after the fact I came across a post on an obscure forum from someone who found a 3DS at that same location that matched the description of mine...

Fast forward to 2021, and I was at a really cool retro game store in East LA called GameHogs.
I was trying to find a launch PS3 when I came across the exact same model of 3DS I had growing up as a kid!

I had to buy it, partially out of a sense of nostalgia, but also because I knew that if I hacked it I could do some really cool stuff with it.

## Hacking explained 
Let's get this out of the way though, hacking a game console is not illegal!

The defintion of hacking in this context is opening closed computer systems for other functions then they were designed for, such as homemade or as they're called in this context "homebrew" software.
Simply put, you bought this gadget so you should be able to do what you want with it!

A close analogy is buying a car and tricking it out with a custom paintjob and redoing the interior.



Honestly I think people call it hacking instead of modding because hacking sounds way cooler.

## Hacking my 3DS
So I'm not going to get too into the details of how to hack a 3DS, this isn't meant to be a tutorial  and the exact methods are always changing.
That being said, vist [3ds.hacks.guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide) for the most up to date information on how to hack your 3DS.
All you need to do is follow the steps listed on there and you'll be good to go. What I will cover though are some of the apps you can install and what they bring to the table.

First off, installers that allow you to install apps directly to the homescreen end with the extension ".cia".
So of cource, the app you use to install these files is called FBI
(FBI open up)

With this app, you can either install app from files on your SD card, or you can scan a QR code 
Apps that have their source code posted on github often have these QR codes as well.

(Show close-up of 3DS screen with QR code scanner)
This is by far the coolest feature I've ever seen built into homebrew!

However, you don't neccesarily have to use this to install all of your software.
The app Universal Updater acts as a sort of 3DS app store with plenty of new apps and updates for them being posted on there.
It's a super easy way to not only download homebrew apps and games but keep them updated without having to deal with file management.

## Homebrew 3DS Apps
My favorite homebrew game you can install from there is actually a fairly popular one.
(open 3DS)
Wordle for the DS!

It's suprisingly great having two screens to play it on and what's even better is that it uses the same list of words as the offical version!
So you can still play along with everyone else to try and get the daily word.

It even generates a QR code with 
so you can still share your score online, or on Mastodon in my case.
(Nerd)

In the past I followed the development of this port on GBAtemp where the developer frequently posts updates and fun little tidbits about this app and the official version of ut.
Link in the description down below.

This of course isn't the only piece of software I've downloaded for my 3DS.
I have Minesweeper, custom themes, an app that showcases different sorting algorithms, and a port of a perfectly harmless dating simulator made by the hacker known as 4chan.

And if you have a "New" 3DS, that's the dumbest name I've ever... never mind 
(Show New 3DS and Xbox One)
if you have the model released later with improved clockspeeds and more RAM you can even watch YouTube on it.

## Emulating Old Games
But honestly, my favorite apps on here are the emulators people have developed for it.

Atari 2600, NES, SNES, Genesis and plenty more retro consoles have emulators developed by fans with insane coding skills.
If you have a New 3DS... still a stupid name, you can even emulate PlayStation One games.

Make no mistake, developing software for this is no easy feat.
The smartphone you have in your pocket is orders of magnitude more powerful and easier to develop for.

Also, remember that ambasador program I mentioned near the start of this video?
For some reason, Nintendo never sold any of the GameBoy Advance games they released for that program.
Despite the fact that they already put in the work to create an emulator for those game, unless you bought in early like me you couldn't buy or play them.

However, thanks to the efforts of those in the homebrew community, you can now use that same emulator to run whatever GBA games you want!

If you're in the market to buy a 3DS for homebrew I fully recommend getting a New 3DS.
I'm perfectly content with my og 3DS, but that's mainly because of the nostalgia factor.
A new 3DS can not only run homebrew software better than this one but there's plenty of stuff that can only be run on it.

Honestly, when this model first came out there was almost no reason to buy it over the original versions, but now when it comes to homebrew it's by far the superior choice.

## The Piracy Issue
To be blunt I'm ok with pirating games for my 3DS, but that's because its a dead platform and me downloading games in 2023 for it doesn't take away any potential earning from developers.
Plus, when I first got this particular 3DS the Nintento eShop (show eshop logo) was still running so I tried downloading "Mario & Luigi: Dream Team" which is on the larger side of 3DS games.
No matter what I tried I couldn't get it to download 
On my Nintendo Switch I flat out refuse to pirate any games, but I do dump the rom files from my cartrages onto it so I don't have to worry about losing my cartridges.
If only there was a console manufacturer that openly allowed homebrew software to be run on their platforms

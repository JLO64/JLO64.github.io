# description: TL;DR I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND YAAAAAAAAY! But I have much more up my sleeve.
---

It's been a hot minute since I last posted here! In fact, as of me writing/uploading this, it has been exactly 5 months since my last blog post. On the personal side things have changed a bunch...

For one, I have a girlfriend!
It's been great being with her, but she's also a huge inspiration and drive for my life now.
Certain things that I have made for her have blossomed into creating opportunities for me I never could have imagined.
Today she even helped me out a bunch with an issue I was super panicking over for my upcoming summer job!
I can safely say that I wouldn't be where I am today without her.

Also, I've moved up the ranks in my council (I think)! I'm no longer a warden and have moved on to being a chancellor. I was just appointed this Tuesday and I'll start next month. My duties include "recruiting and retaining members" and setting up events "that display the values and principles of the Knights of Columbus". Hopefully I can do a lot of good for my brother knights.

Anyhow, the main reason I haven't been posting to this site is because I've been busy working on a product/service that has consumed all of my spare time.
I'm not willing to discuss it right now, but it's super awesome and fulfilling to work on.
For it, I've been writing semi-weekly PDF reports for my "boss".
He doesn't really read them, but I've been dumping my passion for writing into them.
I've been writing on a variety of technical topics and I kinda feel it would be a waste for them to not be read.
As such, I'll be posting censored excerpts of these reports on my blog starting with my thoughts on a particular Python facial recognition library.

I hope you all enjoy the stuff I write!
